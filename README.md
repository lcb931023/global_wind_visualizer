global_wind_visualizer
===========================

Leap Motion enabled 3D Global Wind Flow Visualizer 

A port of @cambecc's [earth] to Processing. The original project visualizes wind flow in great details but every time user rotates the globe it needs a re-render, stuttering navigation. Thought it'll be interesting to build a version that allows looking around the globe without re-rendering, by creating the globe in 3D and use wind map as texture.
